# dependencyinjection
Let's explore various possible ways of using the Scala language to perform dependency injection 
without the need for any framework or run-time magic (Looking at you Guice). Just safe compile-time dependency wiring.

# Approaches:

* Cake Pattern
* Thin cake pattern
* Constructor Parameter
* Macwire (uses MACROS)
* Abstract dependencies
* Structural typing (as parameters)
* Implicits
* Reader Monad
